# Data Mining Mini-Contests
This repository contains the solutions proposed for the three Mini-Contests of the **Data Mining** course (AY 20/21) at the *University of Naples Federico II*.

## Mini-Contest 1: Machine learning for Alzheimer's Disease Detection
[mini-contest-1-classification](https://github.com/fabiod20/data-mining/tree/main/mini-contest-1-classification) directory contains the solution proposed for the first Mini-Contest, which is a **classification problem** that should be solved with traditional *Machine Learning* techniques. The aim of the contest is to determine whether a patient has or not Alzheimer's Disease disease, by means of a Machine Learning model trained on some medical high-level information.

## Mini-Contest 2: Land Surface Temperature Evaluation from Satellite Data
[mini-contest-2-regression](https://github.com/fabiod20/data-mining/tree/main/mini-contest-2-regression) directory contains the solution proposed for the second Mini-Contest, which is a **regression problem** that should be solved with traditional *Machine Learning* techniques. The aim of the contest is to determine the Land Surface Temperature (LST) from satellite data, using data coming from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Landsat-8 missions 1.


## Mini-Contest 3: Parasite Eggs Identification
[mini-contest-3-image-classification](https://github.com/fabiod20/data-mining/tree/main/mini-contest-3-image-classification) directory contains the solution proposed for the third Mini-Contest, which is an **image classification problem** that can be solved with *Deep Learning* techniques. The aim of the contest is to determine whether a parasite egg appears or not in a microscopic image.
