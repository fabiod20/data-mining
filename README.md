# Data Mining Mini-Contests
This repository contains the solutions proposed for the three Mini-Contests of the **Data Mining** course (AY 20/21) at the *University of Naples Federico II*.

## Mini-Contest 1: Machine learning for Alzheimer's Disease Detection
The first Mini-Contest is a **classification problem** that should be solved with traditional *Machine Learning* techniques. The aim of the contest is to determine whether a patient has or not Alzheimer's Disease disease, by means of a Machine Learning model trained on some medical high-level information.

## Mini-Contest 2: Land Surface Temperature Evaluation from Satellite Data
The second Mini-Contest is a **regression problem** that should be solved with traditional *Machine Learning* techniques. The aim of the contest is to determine the Land Surface Temperature (LST) from satellite data, using data coming from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Landsat-8 missions 1.


## Mini-Contest 3: Parasite Eggs Identification
The second Mini-Contest is an **image classification problem** that can be solved with *Deep Learning* techniques. The aim of the contest is to determine whether a parasite egg appears or not in a microscopic image.
